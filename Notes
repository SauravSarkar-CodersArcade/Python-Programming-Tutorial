Programming/Coding: The process of interacting with the computer is called programming/coding.
Programming Language: The language usd to interact with the computer is called programming language.
Eg: C, C++, Java, Python, etc.
Program:
The set of instructions given to the computer to perform a specific task is called program.
In IT industry it is called Source Code.

Complier: An entity which translates High level language to Machine Level Language and vice versa is called the compiler.

Assembly, Machine, Symbolic, High Level.

Data types in Python:
* Build-in - int, float, str, bool
* User-defined - list, set, tuple, dictionaries, arrays, etc.

Variable: It is a memory location where we can store data based on the data type.

Naming Conventions :
1. Camel case: -> variables, functions.
eg: rateOfInterest = 5
2. Pascal case:  -> Classes or Constants.
eg: RateOfInterest = 5;

IDE : An IDE or Integrated Development Environment is an editor where we can write, edit, debug and execute our programs.

Functions in Python:
A function is a block of code which is used to execute a specific task,
 whenever it is called.
A function remains stagnant if it is not called.

1. Arbitrary Arguments.
2. Keyword Arguments.
3. Arbitrary keyword arguments.

lambda function / anonymous function / shortcut function/
oneline function
It is called anonymous because we dont use the def keyword.

function_name = lambda args : expression

Python built-in data types:

* Lists :
* A list is a compound data type.
* It contains items separated by commas and enclosed
within square brackets([]).
* Lists are similar to arrays in C, C++ or Java.
* One difference between them is that the items belonging to
a list can be of different data type.
* The values stored inside a list can be accessed using the []
operator and index.
* Index starts at 0.
* Lists are mutable. Their content can be changed.

* Tuples
* Sets
* Dictionaries

globals() function and applying the global variable constraint.

"""
Q. Use the filter() function to get all even numbers in a list
"""

Tuples:
* Tuples are very similar to lists.
* Only exception is that they are immutable.
* They are created using parentheses, rather than
square brackets.

Sets in Python:
* A set is created by placing all the elements inside
curly brackets {}. Sets can also be created by the set() function.
* The elements can be of different types(int, float, str)
* But, a set cannot have mutable elements like list,
set or dictionary.

# Read a string and find the number of unique characters
Important set operations:
Union
Intersection
Difference
Symmetric Difference

.doc, .docx, .txt, .json, .csv comma separated values
java script object notation

Dictionaries:
* We create a dictionary by placing items inside  curly
brackets {} separated by a comma.
* Each element in a dictionary is a (key - value) pair.
* While values can be of any data type and can repeat,
keys must be unique and must be immutable.

Question:
Determine the number of digits, spaces, upper cases, and
lower cases in a given string.

OOPs in Python:
Object oriented programming is used to solve complex real-world
problems using classes and objects.
Advantages:
1. Code Re-usability
2. Code Efficiency
3. Time management
4. Data Security
5. Scalable Applications
6. Better memory management
7. Data encryption

Class : It is a collection of objects.
Suppose Vehicle is a class.
Then types of vehicles will be the objects.
Ex: Car, Bus. truck, etc
And, each object will have attributes or properties:
Ex: name, size, colour, price
And, each object will have a behaviour called methods:
ex: sound(), brake(), etc.

self is the default parameter inside all methods in a class. It is replaced by the calling object.
It behaves the same as the 'this' keyword in C++ or Java.

A programming language is called object-oriented because of its
four important pillars:
1. Inheritance : Accessing the properties of the parent class and using them in the child class
is called inheritance. Inheritance can be of the following types:
Single level
Multi level
Multiple
Hybrid
Hierarchical
Memory leak: Unnecessary data from parent class will be available to the child class,
this is called memory leakage.
Parent & Child
Super & Sub
Base class & Child class

In multiple inheritance, we inherit multiple classes by separating them with a comma.


2. Abstraction:
Hiding the implementation details and only showing the functionality to the end-user
is called abstraction. It is used to increase the efficiency of the product and also for
data security/hiding.
Ex: Remote Control of a TV:
We are just bothered about changing the channels, increasing/decreasing the volume
and so on. We are not worried about the technology being used underneath the remote.

Focus on what is happening rather than how it is happening.

In Python we achieve abstraction using the ABC class.
Abstract Base Class (ABC)   (0-100%)
Abstract Methods
Note:
If we use only an abstract method in the class, it is 100% abstraction.
If we have even one single normal / concrete method, it is not 100% abstraction.

An abstract method is a method with empty bodies.
The body of the method is provided in the child class which inherits the class.

3. Polymorphism :
Poly -> many - morph -> shapes / forms
The process by which same method can behave differently in different scenarios
is called polymorphism.
1. Compile - time polymorphism Overloading  (Same class)
2. Run - time - polymorphism Overriding (Different classes)
Method overloading  (Not possible in Python) (C++ & Java)
Operator Overloading. +,-, <, >
Method overriding: Same function acts differently in different classes.

Example:
Inside class -> Student
In a restaurant -> Customer
At home -> Son/Daughter
Lady - teacher, wife, mother
The person doesn't change. Only the behaviour / character changes.

Duck Typing ? TCS Infosys, Capgemini Interpreted / dynamic programming language
As long as it behaves like a duck. walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck.
As long as a function gets data, it executes and gives output. It is not bothered about
the source from where it is coming.

4. Encapsulation : The process of binding the data members, variables and methods into
one single block or entity is called encapsulation.
It is done so that the data is not accidentally modified.
Capsule :
It safeguards the medicine inside it and wraps the contents into a
block/protective layer.

We achieve encapsulation by using double underscore for the data members
and access them using getters and setters.
The data members are private here. Getters and setters are used to provide access
to the user.

a. Domain / expertise.
b. Target Profile.

d. 2 JDs.
e. Domain for internship/training.


File Handling Concepts in Python:
Four important modes:
1. read   'r'
2. write  'w' -> create if not available. (overwriting)
3. append 'a' -> (adding new data and keeping the earlier data intact)
4. create  'x' -> Create a file if it doesn't
exist, but will throw an error if it exists.

CRUD : Create, Read, Update, Delete
text file -> .txt (manually)
excel files -> .xls, .xlsx (binary) openpyxl
json -> .json (json)

Array : Collection of data based on the data type.
In python we can use lists as arrays.
Types:
Single Dimensional array.
Multi Dimensional Array.

Python JSON:
JSON means JavaScript Object Notation.
It is used to transfer data between computers (Client/Server machines)
It is used in APIs.
json is language independent. We can use json in any language.
But we need to convert it to json_object.
In Python we have built in module/library json.
There are two important functions:
1. loads()
2. dumps()

1. Create a json
2. Read a json
